# ImdbExplorer

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Visit website

`angular-cli-ghpages` allowed me to easily deploy this application to GitHub pages. Check it out [here](https://bbrassart.github.io/imdb-explorer/).

## WIP

This app is obviously a work in progress. There are some major issues but things will get better... if I find the time.
